- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mike!

I'm a data center technician by trade, keeping your favorite cloud services healthy and deploying the latest machine learning hardware so that mankind can have access to AI. Sometimes I catch the coding bug and reach a small goal before retreating back to civilian life to forget 80% of what I learned. 

To shake things up a bit more, I love Windows, I love Mac OSX, Linux is a terrible desktop OS, but UNIX shells are great - and before you pass judgement, you should know that I use neovim.
